## Formula

The amortized cost $A(S,T,L)$ is calculated using the following formula:

$$A(S,T,L) = \frac{h(S,L)}{T} + \frac{S}{T} \cdot \frac{(1+g(L))^{T+1}-1}{g(L)}$$

Where:

- $S$ = Starting salary
- $T$ = Duration (weeks)
- $L$ = Asset level (1-7)
- $g(L)$ = Growth factor: $(L-1) \times 0.25\%$
- $h(S,L)$ = Hiring cost (linear interpolation from market data)
